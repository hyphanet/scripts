## TODO MAJOR: Get the latest build number from somewhere other than the repository, e.g. Freenet, announcements, etc.
## TODO MAJOR: Verify the installers
## TODO MAJOR: Fetch the freenet jar from multiple sources e.g. Freenet over FCP.
## TODO Option to avoid re-cloning each time. It may be safer to re-clone each time however.
## TODO: Automatically download freenet-ext.jar if not present, in a secure fashion.
## TODO: Deal with freenet-ext.jar updating automatically.
## TODO: Verify freenet-ext.jar itself.
## TODO: Hard-code the certificate for SSL see the code in update.sh in app-new_installer
## TODO: Detect who released it and complain if not the same compiler? Or even install several copies?
